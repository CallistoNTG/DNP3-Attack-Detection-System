#DNP3 Dissector for Scapy

The Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) is defined in [IEEE Std 1815](https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1815-2012.html) for the purpose of distributing event data for operation on a variety of communication media consistent with the makeup of most electric power communication systems.

This project is work-in-progress by the Queensland University of Technology(QUT) [Information Security discipline](https://www.qut.edu.au/science-engineering/our-schools/school-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/information-security) and was developed to study cyber attacks on DNP3 critical infrustrcutre. The work can be demonstrated in our paper, [Real-Time and Interactive Attacks on DNP3 Critical Infrastructure Using Scapy](http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV161Rodofile.pdf), published in the CRPIT and Presented at the Australasian Information Security Conference (AISC 2015) in Sydney Australia.
